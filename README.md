README

## Introduction

This project involves checking whether the `prompts.csv` file from the [awesome-chatgpt-prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) repository has been updated. If an update is available, the new version is acquired and converted to a JSON file format. 

The JSON file is used in the Prompt Store on https://chatbot.theb.ai/ for now. 

## Usage

The prompts.json file can be accessed using the following import link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lancelotly/autoConvert-awesome-chatgpt-prompts-to-Json/main/prompts.json, and then imported into the Prompt Store for use.

## Updating the Prompts

The `prompts.csv` file is checked periodically for updates. If an update is available, the new version is automatically converted to a JSON file and uploaded to this repository. To ensure that you have the latest prompts, simply download the `prompts.json` file from the above import link.

## Contributing

If you find any issues with the prompts or would like to contribute additional prompts, please create a pull request in the [awesome-chatgpt-prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) repository.
